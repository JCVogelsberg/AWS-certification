ADVANTAGES
- Cloud computing
  * No upfront pymts
  * Auto scalable
  * Pay-as-you-go model (pay for bandwidth you use)


-----------------------------------

- Supports most operating systems
  * RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Amazon Linux, Oracle 

  * Amazon Route 53:
    + translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 
    + Amazon sez:
      = "A reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications"
      = "A highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service."
    + Name is a ref. to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed
    + Route 53 also enables:
      = AWS customers to route users to non-AWS infrastructure 
      = Monitor the health of their application & its endpoints
    + Amazon provides a service-level agreement of the service always being available at all times (100% available)
    + Documentation: https://aws.amazon.com/route53/
    + See also: my file "Amazon Route 53 - ELI5.txt"

    + Allows users to isolate sections of AWS for private use
    + Provides more "granular" control over security
